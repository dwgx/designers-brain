## The core principle: progressive disclosure

Every skills-compatible agent follows the same three-tier loading strategy:

| Tier | What's loaded | When | Token cost |
| - | - | - | - |
| 1. Catalog | Name + description | Session start | \~50-100 tokens per skill |
| 2. Instructions | Full `SKILL.md` body | When the skill is activated | \<5000 tokens (recommended) |
| 3. Resources | Scripts, references, assets | When the instructions reference them | Varies |

The model sees the catalog from the start, so it knows what skills are available. When it decides a skill is relevant, it loads the full instructions. If those instructions reference supporting files, the model loads them individually as needed.

This keeps the base context small while giving the model access to specialized knowledge on demand. An agent with 20 installed skills doesn't pay the token cost of 20 full instruction sets upfront — only the ones actually used in a given conversation.

## Step 1: Discover skills

At session startup, find all available skills and load their metadata.

### Where to scan

Which directories you scan depends on your agent's environment. Most locally-running agents scan at least two scopes:

* **Project-level** (relative to the working directory): Skills specific to a project or repository.
* **User-level** (relative to the home directory): Skills available across all projects for a given user.

Other scopes are possible too — for example, organization-wide skills deployed by an admin, or skills bundled with the agent itself. The right set of scopes depends on your agent's deployment model.

Within each scope, consider scanning both a **client-specific directory** and the **`.agents/skills/` convention**:

| Scope | Path | Purpose |
| - | - | - |
| Project | `<project>/.<your-client>/skills/` | Your client's native location |
| Project | `<project>/.agents/skills/` | Cross-client interoperability |
| User | `~/.<your-client>/skills/` | Your client's native location |
| User | `~/.agents/skills/` | Cross-client interoperability |

The `.agents/skills/` paths have emerged as a widely-adopted convention for cross-client skill sharing. While the Agent Skills specification does not mandate where skill directories live (it only defines what goes inside them), scanning `.agents/skills/` means skills installed by other compliant clients are automatically visible to yours, and vice versa.

<Note>
  Some implementations also scan `.claude/skills/` (both project-level and user-level) for pragmatic compatibility, since many existing skills are installed there. Other additional locations include ancestor directories up to the git root (useful for monorepos), [XDG](https://specifications.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/latest/) config directories, and user-configured paths.
</Note>

### What to scan for

Within each skills directory, look for **subdirectories containing a file named exactly `SKILL.md`**:

```
~/.agents/skills/
├── pdf-processing/
│   ├── SKILL.md          ← discovered
│   └── scripts/
│       └── extract.py
├── data-analysis/
│   └── SKILL.md          ← discovered
└── README.md             ← ignored (not a skill directory)
```

Practical scanning rules:

* Skip directories that won't contain skills, such as `.git/` and `node_modules/`
* Optionally respect `.gitignore` to avoid scanning build artifacts
* Set reasonable bounds (e.g., max depth of 4-6 levels, max 2000 directories) to prevent runaway scanning in large directory trees

## Step 3: Disclose available skills to the model

Tell the model what skills exist without loading their full content. This is [tier 1 of progressive disclosure](#the-core-principle-progressive-disclosure).

### Building the skill catalog

For each discovered skill, include `name`, `description`, and optionally `location` (the path to the `SKILL.md` file) in whatever structured format suits your stack — XML, JSON, or a bulleted list all work:

```xml theme={null}
<available_skills>
  <skill>
    <name>pdf-processing</name>
    <description>Extract PDF text, fill forms, merge files. Use when handling PDFs.</description>
    <location>/home/user/.agents/skills/pdf-processing/SKILL.md</location>
  </skill>
  <skill>
    <name>data-analysis</name>
    <description>Analyze datasets, generate charts, and create summary reports.</description>
    <location>/home/user/project/.agents/skills/data-analysis/SKILL.md</location>
  </skill>
</available_skills>
```

The `location` field serves two purposes: it enables file-read activation (see [Step 4](#step-4-activate-skills)), and it gives the model a base path for resolving relative references in the skill body (like `scripts/evaluate.py`). If your dedicated activation tool provides the skill directory path in its result (see [Structured wrapping](#structured-wrapping) in Step 4), you can omit `location` from the catalog. Otherwise, include it.

Each skill adds roughly 50-100 tokens to the catalog. Even with dozens of skills installed, the catalog remains compact.

### Where to place the catalog

Two approaches are common:

**System prompt section**: Add the catalog as a labeled section in the system prompt, preceded by brief instructions on how to use skills. This is the simplest approach and works with any model that has access to a file-reading tool.

**Tool description**: Embed the catalog in the description of a dedicated skill-activation tool (see [Step 4](#step-4-activate-skills)). This keeps the system prompt clean and naturally couples discovery with activation.

Both work. System prompt placement is simpler and more broadly compatible; tool description embedding is cleaner when you have a dedicated activation tool.

### Behavioral instructions

Include a short instruction block alongside the catalog telling the model how and when to use skills. The wording depends on which activation mechanism you support (see [Step 4](#step-4-activate-skills)):

**If the model activates skills by reading files:**

```
The following skills provide specialized instructions for specific tasks.
When a task matches a skill's description, use your file-read tool to load
the SKILL.md at the listed location before proceeding.
When a skill references relative paths, resolve them against the skill's
directory (the parent of SKILL.md) and use absolute paths in tool calls.
```

**If the model activates skills via a dedicated tool:**

```
The following skills provide specialized instructions for specific tasks.
When a task matches a skill's description, call the activate_skill tool
with the skill's name to load its full instructions.
```

Keep these instructions concise. The goal is to tell the model that skills exist and how to load them — the skill content itself provides the detailed instructions once loaded.

### Filtering

Some skills should be excluded from the catalog. Common reasons:

* The user has disabled the skill in settings
* A permission system denies access to the skill
* The skill has opted out of model-driven activation (e.g., via a `disable-model-invocation` flag)

**Hide filtered skills entirely** from the catalog rather than listing them and blocking at activation time. This prevents the model from wasting turns attempting to load skills it can't use.

### When no skills are available

If no skills are discovered, omit the catalog and behavioral instructions entirely. Don't show an empty `<available_skills/>` block or register a skill tool with no valid options — this would confuse the model.

## Step 4: Activate skills

When the model or user selects a skill, deliver the full instructions into the conversation context. This is [tier 2 of progressive disclosure](#the-core-principle-progressive-disclosure).

### Model-driven activation

Most implementations rely on the model's own judgment as the activation mechanism, rather than implementing harness-side trigger matching or keyword detection. The model reads the catalog (from [Step 3](#step-3-disclose-available-skills-to-the-model)), decides a skill is relevant to the current task, and loads it.

Two implementation patterns:

**File-read activation**: The model calls its standard file-read tool with the `SKILL.md` path from the catalog. No special infrastructure needed — the agent's existing file-reading capability is sufficient. The model receives the file content as a tool result. This is the simplest approach when the model has file access.

**Dedicated tool activation**: Register a tool (e.g., `activate_skill`) that takes a skill name and returns the content. This is required when the model can't read files directly, and optional (but useful) even when it can. Advantages over raw file reads:

* Control what content is returned — e.g., strip YAML frontmatter or preserve it (see [What the model receives](#what-the-model-receives) below)
* Wrap content in structured tags for identification during context management
* List bundled resources (e.g., `references/*`) alongside the instructions
* Enforce permissions or prompt for user consent
* Track activation for analytics

<Tip>
  If you use a dedicated activation tool, constrain the `name` parameter to the set of valid skill names (e.g., as an enum in the tool schema). This prevents the model from hallucinating nonexistent skill names. If no skills are available, don't register the tool at all.
